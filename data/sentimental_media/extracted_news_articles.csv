This time the Fed's steering the ship;Although it may not feel like it, the cryptocurrency industry has reason to celebrate. True, it's been a bumpy ride this year — and for a good while, it seemed like a never-ending downhill trip. But Bitcoin is no stranger to plunges. The reason for jubilation is that while there has been lots and lots of pain, there haven't been the same fears about bitcoin's survival and what happens next. That's thanks in part to recent wins that give the young asset class some legitimacy. It's also because investors understand better why it moves and how it trades: the Fed is steering this ship now – and crypto traders, like stock traders, are waiting with bated breath for the central bank's next signal later this week.

Bitcoin remains below $20,000 for now as investors are very cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve decision tomorrow, followed by a news conference with Chair Jerome Powell.The market is currently pricing in a probability of an 82% chance of a 75 basis point rate hike, and a 18% chance of a 100 basis point rate hike. As the chance of at least a 75 basis point rate hike has been fully priced in by investors, I think a 75 basis point rate hike could be priced in, in the short-term.

Crypto blockchains are a highly discussed topic. Blockchain is used by many cryptographic networks (e.g. Bitcoin and Ethereum) to enable different transactions.

Wright's lawyers told an Oslo court Wednesday in the seventh and final day of a civil case brought by Twitter personality Hodlonaut.District Court Judge Helen Engebrigtsen must now decide whether Hodlonaut's comments that Wright was a 'fraud' were lawful free speech.

Welcome to Bloomberg Crypto, our twice-weekly look at Bitcoin, blockchain and more. In today's edition, Hannah Miller explores one sunny spot (for now) in crypto:

The plunge in crypto prices and blowups of major blockchain projects like Terra have cast a pall over the digital-asset industry; as a result many of the venture capitalists who helped fuel last year's boom aren't as free with their money now. In the past few months, they've pulled back on funding, leaving some startups with less financing than planned or at lower valuations — or in some cases even unable to seal a deal at all."

But how do traders manage to fudge the numbers? And what exactly is cooking behind crypto's cryptic facade? The answer lies in an age-old practice: Wash trading. This is when people sell assets to themselves, to create the illusion that trade is occurring more than it actually is. Although wash trading was banned in the United States in 1936, the practice is picking up steam again in the legal gray areas that color the crypto market.

Ethereum, which builds on Bitcoin by incorporating smart contracts, allows its ledger to record data, spawning the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Ethereum's former proof-of-work system — one currently used by Bitcoin, which remains the leading cryptocurrency — secured its blockchain by requiring 'miners' to solve difficult puzzles that consumed exponentially increasing amounts of computational power in order to modify it.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sizzling inflation that helped send 2-year U.S. Treasury yields to fresh 14-year highs continued to burn some of the winners of the so-called pandemic bubble Friday.

There are limits to adding evermore layers

One of the main problems with adding further layers on top of one another is that the security of the rollups is problematic.

Buterin makes the example that if rollups increase transaction output by 8x, then it isn't as simple as rollups on top of rollups scaling to 64x the speed, since a layer 3 will not be able to inherit the same degree of security from the layer one that the layer 2 does."

Most get confused on ‘fungible' vis-a-vis ‘non–fungible'. From a basic understanding, ‘fungible' means any asset or good that can be interchanged with other assets or goods of similar type. Money is fungible because whether you have a single 2,000 rupee note or four 500 rupee notes or ten 200 rupee notes or twenty 100 rupee notes, the value is still the same for everyone. Gold, silver, bronze, metals of the same type, are also all fungible, as are other commodities, and even bonds and shares.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.13%, and the high-beta Nasdaq-100 Index fell 5.77%. Treasury yields surged.

Blockchain, DeFi and web3 technologies continue to evolve rapidly in a world of wild extremes. How extreme? Consider these two examples.

It's hard to know where to start on a day like today. While the Fed's hawkish rate hike is probably the dominant driver in the broader markets, the dangerous nuclear threats from the Kremlin are causing quite a stir and then there's the small matter of Japan's first FX intervention in 24 years, which has triggered some huge moves in the yen
Fed Resists Urge
The Fed's decision to hike by 75 basis points, despite the obvious temptation to opt for a full percentage point, was probably sensible given the scale of tightening we've already seen this year."

There is one in fact: the '4% rule.'
The 4% rule is a rule of thumb used by most financial advisors that withdrawing a maximum of 4% of your portfolio per year will allow you to live indefinitely on your savings. The rule is based on 75 years of stock market history, and while there's debate about what the exact percentage should be, flipping the rule around (1/.04) means that you need to save 25 times your annual spending to be 'set for life."
